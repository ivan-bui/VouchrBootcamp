# VouchrBootcamp
Search using Twitter API


Vouchr Bootcamp - Due Date: May 5
Goal - Create an ios/android app that displays tweets based on a search term.

The app should feature a search bar that lets a user type in a search term. The app should then load tweets based on that search term and display them in a list. 

Each tweet list item should have the following:
Twitter username of the person who tweeted.
Twitter profile image of the person who tweeted.
The text of the tweet.

There should be no lag when I scroll through the list.

Twitter api
Note that the API requires that the request be authenticated(https://dev.twitter.com/oauth)
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search

Android Recommended Libraries
When adding libraries it's recommended you use gradle
Retrofit (network calls)
Picasso (loading image)
iOS Recommended Libraries

Extra Points:
Paging - When I scroll down, more tweets are fetched and added to the list.

We will demo these friday!
